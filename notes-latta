# NOTES — Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP) Fork

## Why I forked this

This repo is a fork of **SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Platform)** — a widely used C++ library for network and graph analysis, capable of handling very large graphs and many structural algorithms. SNAP is a foundational tool in network science and graph mining, used in research and applied settings. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

I’m interested in how **network analysis techniques apply to trust, safety, and relationship systems**, especially when modeling behaviors such as attention flows, interaction networks, and signals of coordinated behavior in social/dating platforms.

This fork is *for study and reflection* — to connect concrete graph analysis tools to integrity & risk signal thinking rather than to claim development ownership.

## Core ideas in this codebase

SNAP implements a large set of algorithms and utilities for network analysis, including: :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- Graph representations with node and edge attributes
- Structural properties (e.g., centrality, connectivity, clustering)
- Community detection and decomposition
- Graph generation models (forest fire, preferential attachment)
- Traversal, flow, and random walk algorithms
- Graph mining examples and tutorials

These elements point to core network analysis concepts that underlie relational systems. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Why this matters for trust & safety

Understanding graph structure and dynamics is useful for trust and safety because:

- **Risk propagation**: Harmful behavior often appears as patterns across interaction networks.
- **Cluster/Community structure**: Identifying tightly connected groups can help spot coordinated malicious activity or support communities.
- **Centrality and role**: Core nodes may represent highly active or influential users whose behavior merits deeper signal weighting.
- **Evolution over time**: Structural changes in a network can reveal shifts in engagement or abuse patterns.

Network science is not a silver bullet, but it offers lenses through which systems can be analyzed quantitatively.

## What I’m exploring here

- Which structural measures correlate with abuse risk vs normal interaction
- How graph models (e.g., preferential attachment, community detection) reveal hubs of activity
- How interaction networks differ between healthy vs harmful engagement
- What network features could inform *risk signals* without inspecting message content

## Next steps / open questions

- How to bridge SNAP’s C++ performance focus with higher-level Python tooling (e.g., NetworkX, igraph) for rapid experimentation
- How to define *meaningful* edge weights and node features in dating/intimacy platforms
- How network properties can inform *progressive friction* or *priority review queues*
